# Flamingo Docs

Overall documentation - for docs.flamingo.me

This Repo contains documentation that is general.

Also it has the "build" logic to fetch exiting Documentation from the Core Repositories and finaly compile a complete documentation out of it.

The *table of content* in the mkdocs result is useing the H1 Header of the Markdown file as Title of the page.
So make sure each .md file used has a useful h1 headline as first line!

# Build it local:
