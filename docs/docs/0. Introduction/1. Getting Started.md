# Getting started with Flamingo

## Development setup and first steps

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/)

2. Check out flamingo traing into `$GOPATH/src/go.aoe.com/training`
(go.aoe.com will be our [namespace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Organization)).
```sh
  git clone git@gitlab.aoe.com:shared/flamingo/training.git $GOPATH/src/go.aoe.com/training
```

3. Install `dep` via `go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`.
Then download dependencies via `dep ensure`.
(Or `dep ensure -vendor-only` for fast and just the necessary dependencies).

4. Then run the frontend template build:
`cd training/frontend && yarn && yarn build`

 You can also start the template dev mode by:
 `yarn dev`

5. Your entrypoint is `training/training.go`, this is where the application is started.
   Run `go run training.go` to see a list of possible commands.
   Run `go run training.go serve` to start the server

Please make sure to set your on-save setting to `go imports` in Gogland! (Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Go > On Save)
