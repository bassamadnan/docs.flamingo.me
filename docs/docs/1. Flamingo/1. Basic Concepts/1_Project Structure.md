## PROJECTNAME structure

Normaly this is where all the project specific stuff belongs to.
(Name it like you want)

The Main executable should do:
* build the context tree for your project
* start the root command (delegate work to core/cmd package)

### Configuration Context

A configuration context allows to run several different flamingo powered sites in one installation.
Typical usecases are localisations and/or specific subsites.

A Context represents:
* a list of modules for each context
* configurations (that are loaded from the coresponsing "config" folder)
* a baseurl: This is the first part of the URL - and its telling flamingo which context should be loaded.
* Contexts can be nested in a tree like structure - this allows you to inherit the properties of contexts from parents to childs
