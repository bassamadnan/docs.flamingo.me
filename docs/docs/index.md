* open source
* written in go
* easy to learn
* fast and flexible

Go as simple, powerful and typesafe language is great to implement and scale serverside logic.
Flamingo has a clean architecture with clean and clear dependencies in mind.

It's architecture is especially useful to build "frontends" for your headless microservice architecture.

With "Flamingo Carotene" and "Flamingo Commerce" you get your toolkit for building **blazing fast commerce experience layers**


# The Flamingo Ecosystem

The Flamingo ecosystem consists of the following main projects:

* *Flamingo*: This is the go based (micro)framework with all Core and Framework modules.
* *Flamingo Carotene*: Npm modules that provide the frontend build pipeline features - featuring pug, SaSS and atomic design pattern.
* *Flamingo Commerce*: Powerful e-commerce features that you can use to build flexible and moder e-commerce applications

Related to this three main projects you find a couple of training and example projects.

## Flamingo Carotene
Is the frontend build pipeline featuring pug and atomic design pattern

It can be used to implement modern and blazing fast commerce web applications.

## Flamingo Commerce

Flamingo Commerce uses "Domain Driven Design" with a "technology free" domain model by using the layering approach "Ports and Adapters" for its modules.
The different modules provide „domain“, „application“ and „interface“ logic around commerce features.

According to „ports and adapters“ these modules can be used with your own „Adapters“ to interact with any API or microservice you want.
